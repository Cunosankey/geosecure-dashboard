1. Filter panel should move to the right when the sidebar opens. 

2. When you insert the more filters it doesnt seem to work properly. It only cares about city and type 

3. I should put more plots in for each type, so it shows more diverse data points 

4. should i move all my hooks into a file for themselves so that i have them all together in a single file or in a folder with a file for each hook?
